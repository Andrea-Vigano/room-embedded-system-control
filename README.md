# room-embedded-system-control
An embedded Arduino mega2560 system

This project is intended to be a way to automate and controll some things in a room-pc system, like hardware status and temperatures, 
leds strip effects, when to turn the system on or off depending on time, day and other parameters. The leds have to be coordinated with
and rgb keyboard that can loop between some different effects with a keystroke.

The board used is an Arduino mega2560, the led strip is a WS2811, and the system specs are yet to be defined.
The IDE used is Clion with PlatformIO integration.
